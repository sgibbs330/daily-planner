# daily-planner

I created a calander application that maps out each hour of the day and allows for entries to be saved in each column. The page updates as the hours pass, grey indicating past times, red indicating current times, and green indicating present times in the day. 

- This appliation is powered by jquery and bootstrap. 
- It is paired to run with HTML and CSS.
- When an item is keyed into the application, the item will be saved in local storage.
- The page has the current time and date at the top of the page.
